## Nota Bene

Included are two sets of progams:
* [Node AST](https://github.com/CompilerConstruction/GoLang/tree/Ciaran-ASTNodes/ASTNodes) program we showed to you in the lab.
* [Vector AST](https://github.com/CompilerConstruction/GoLang/tree/Ciaran-ASTNodes/Vector%20AST) program we buildt as per your suggestion of using vectors instead of Node Pointers

Included in both are the testing files used by the parsers.
